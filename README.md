# SQL-Interpreter
A C++-based SQL interpreter that was made without any advanced C++ concepts.

This interpreter was the first assignment for my CS202 class, and it was designed to review concepts learned from CS135 including arrays, functions, and structs. This particular interpreter was designed around a satellite database that allows a user to search for specific pieces of data relating to satellites. 

Currently, this is the most complex program I have written so far. This is primarily due to how complex the error-checking can get with the program alongside not having learned concepts such as recursion which would have greatly helped my program's development. Despite these challenges, I was one of only a few people who successfully got their program to work, and I am incredibly proud of it to this day. 

This program made me realized that I'm going to have face challenges while programming, but I shouldn't stop being motivated because of those challenges.
