# SQL-Interpreter
A C++-based SQL interpreter that was made without any advanced C++ concepts.

This interpreter was the first assignment for my CS202 (Computer Science II) class, and it was designed to review concepts learned from CS135 (Computer Science I) including arrays, functions, and structs. This particular interpreter was designed around a satellite database that allows a user to search for specific pieces of data relating to satellites. 

Currently, this is the most complex program I have written so far due to how complex the error-checking can get in order to ensure the user inputted a correct query. Additionally, this program was written at the beginning of my CS202 class which means I haven't yet learned concepts like recursion which would have made error-checking a lot easier. Despite these challenges, I ended up being one of only a few people who successfully got their program to work, and I am still incredibly proud of it to this day.

Overall, this program made me realized that I'm going to encounter plenty of challenges throughout my coding career, but I should never feel discouraged or demotivated about them. I should accept these challenges and do my best to solve them no matter how long it takes!
